## Overview

This project is designed on the intention for users to be able to view the webpage both on a desktop and a mobile device. 

Taking into consideration the width of the desktop screen to be 1440px and that of the mobile device as 375px repectively, the webpage was designed purely with [HTML] and [CSS] therefore making the webpage static.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

- The first approach was to consider building the desktop layout of the webpage
- Then began rendering the markup of the webpage with html elements
- In designing the markup, the semantic html elements were used 
- The webpage is divided into two particular sections enclosed by the [main] tag
- Meanwhile the elements were grouped using the block element [div] to enable effective styling
- Styling was done using the css properties with the aid of required class names
- The aforementioned css properties such as the font family, colors, font size, font weight, etc. were provided in the [style-guide.md] file
- In order to ascertain the required layout flow of the elements, styling properties like the margin, padding, were used
- The CSS grid and flexbox properties were used also to ensure better web layout flow
- The next phase was to design the web layout for the mobile device 
- In this case, we used the [@media] Queries property to create responsiveness of the webpage for mobile devices


### Built with
